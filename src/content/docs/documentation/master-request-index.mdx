# Master Request With Payload And Headers Async

This node is the same as the previous one, but it is async, so it will not block the main thread, executing the response in an event.

# Master Request With Payload And Headers Async Without Encoding

This node is the same as the previous one, but it is async and does not encode the body payload and headers so you can send raw data.

| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| success | Boolean | If the JSON was decoded successfully |
| value   | String  | The value of the key            |
