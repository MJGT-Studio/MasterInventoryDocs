# (02) Project integration (Controller Events Setup)

Now you need to add the `BPC_MasterInventory` component to your player controller, to do that follow the next steps.

<div class='flex flex-row bg-gray-900 h-10 w-full rounded-[30px]'>
	<span class='flex flex-col justify-center text-white font-bold grow-[1] max-w-[90%] text-center'>Important:</span>
	<div class='w-[10%] bg-red-400 rounded-r-2xl shadow-[0_0_20px_#d00000]'></div>
</div>
> i am assuming you already have a player controller for you game, if not please create one and attach it to your game mode.

### 5.  Now open your player controller and add the `BPC_MasterInventory` component.
![Img5](/MasterInventoryDocs/getStarted/05.png)

### 6.  Now your controller should look like this.
![Img6](/MasterInventoryDocs/getStarted/06.png)

<Callout icon="👌" type="info">
    Next we need to transfer the example events from the `BP_MasterInventoryController` to your controller, to do that follow the next steps.
</Callout>

### 7.  Find and open the `BP_MasterInventoryController` in the content browser.
![Img7](/MasterInventoryDocs/getStarted/07.png)

### 8.  Next copy the events from the `BP_MasterInventoryController` to your controller.
> Best tip here is to copy from botton to top so the engine don't get confused with the references, there is not need to copy all the events, but if you don't you may miss some functionality.

<Callout icon="👌" type="info">
    The pivotal event is 'StartMasterInventory.' This event initiates and assigns all inputs to the player pawn.
</Callout>

<div class='flex flex-row bg-gray-900 h-10 w-full rounded-[30px]'>
	<span class='flex flex-col justify-center text-white font-bold grow-[1] max-w-[90%] text-center'>Important:</span>
	<div class='w-[10%] bg-red-400 rounded-r-2xl shadow-[0_0_20px_#d00000]'></div>
</div>
> Now is recomented to have a reference to the player pawn in your player controller, in this way we can acess the spawn point. camera and some other functionality that we goin to use in the interface implementation.

### 9. Now you need to add the `BPI_ActorInventory` interface to your player controller.

![Img9](/MasterInventoryDocs/getStarted/09.png)

### 10. Now you need to implement 3 main interface events, `i_ReturnPlayetActorRef`, `i_ReturnSpawnPoint` and `I_ReturnInventoryReference`.

#### 1: First lets implement the `i_ReturnSpawnPoint` event, this will tell master inventory where to spawn the items when droped.

![Img11](/MasterInventoryDocs/getStarted/11.png)

#### 2: Now lets implement the `I_ReturnInventoryReference` event, this will return the inventory reference to the master inventory so we can access in external blueprints.

![Img12](/MasterInventoryDocs/getStarted/12.png)

#### 3: Now lets implement the `i_ReturnPlayetActorRef` event, this will return the player reference to the master inventory so we can also access in external blueprints and internal.
